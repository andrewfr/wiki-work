; Abstract ''(up to 300 words to describe your proposal)''
: The Wikimedia Foundation engages in legal advocacy, including sometimes bringing litigation where necessary for the Foundation and the broader movement together (such as our lawsuit against the NSA) or weighing in through amicus briefs on important legal cases that could affect the Wikimedia projects, the overall health of the internet, or the Foundation's operations. This presentation will cover how we decide where to engage in legal advocacy and review several of the cases over the past year. This review will include the current status of the case against the NSA, our interventions to oppose worldwide court orders, and our fight against attempts at weakening of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that protects online service providers. We will also review our briefs opposing the executive orders restricting travel to the United States.
